#Personal Cheatsheet

##A HTML and CSS Codecademy Project

The aim of this project was to create a HTML cheatsheet, and i choose the theme 'Html Tables', since it was already suggested as the solution example for this challenge.

Since i already had work with bootstrap and CSS Flexbox, i applied some basics of it to give responsiveness to the page.

I tried to be as minimalistic as possible, since i'm eager to keep pursuing the next steps on my learning path.
